# excel2r

**Migrate your entire Excel workbook to R — data and logic — in one step.**

Upload any multi-tab `.xlsx` workbook and get a fully standalone package: tidy CSV data files and an R script (base R only, zero dependencies) that recreates every formula without needing Excel at runtime. Edit the CSVs, rerun the script, get updated results. Built-in verification compares every computed value against Excel's cached results before you commit to the migration.

## What This Does (and Doesn't Do)

**It does:**
- Extract every formula from your workbook and translate it to equivalent R code
- Resolve cross-sheet references and determine the correct execution order (topological sort)
- Detect named tables (ListObjects) and generate properly named R data frames with real column headers
- Export raw data as tidy CSVs — one per sheet, formula cells excluded — so the Excel file is no longer needed
- Verify computed R values against Excel's cached formula results, classifying matches, precision diffs, and real mismatches
- Produce a self-contained `.R` script using only base R — zero packages to install
- Flag unsupported functions clearly so nothing is silently skipped

**It doesn't:**
- Recreate the workbook visually (no formatting, charts, or cell styles)
- Replace Excel as a UI — the output is R code for scripting and automation
- Handle dynamic references (`INDIRECT`, `OFFSET`), array formulas, or structured table references (`Table1[Column]`)

**Use it when you want to:**
- **Migrate** — move an Excel-based workflow entirely into R, no Excel dependency at runtime
- **Automate** — plug formula logic into a pipeline, schedule it, chain it with other scripts
- **Verify** — confirm the R translation produces the same results as Excel before committing
- **Audit** — read every formula as plain R, line by line, in version-controllable code
- **Iterate** — edit input values in CSV, rerun the script, get updated results

## Two Output Modes

### Excel mode (default)
Generated script reads from the `.xlsx` file at runtime. You still need the Excel file.

### CSV standalone mode
Download a `.zip` containing:
```
excel2r_output/
├── generated_script.R    ← base R only, zero dependencies
├── data/
│   ├── Products.csv      ← tidy format: row, col, value
│   ├── Q1_Sales.csv
│   └── ...
└── README.txt
```
Delete the Excel file. Edit the CSVs to change inputs. Rerun the script. Done.

## Generated Output Explained

### 1. Data — tidy CSV per sheet

Each CSV contains only hardcoded (non-formula) cells in a compact long format:

```
row,col,value
1,A,Company Report
3,B,Revenue
3,C,Q1
4,B,North
4,C,150
5,B,South
5,C,80
7,B,Total
```

No empty cells, no formula cells. Just the raw inputs that feed into the formulas.

### 2. Grid reconstruction — CSV becomes a data frame

The generated script rebuilds the Excel grid from the tidy CSV using an embedded helper:

```r
Products <- reconstruct_grid(
  file.path(data_dir, "Products.csv"),
  max_row = 8, max_col = 4
)
```

After reconstruction, `Products$C[4]` is `150` — same position as cell C4 in Excel.

### 3. Named tables — real column names for downstream use

When the workbook contains named tables (Insert → Table in Excel), the script generates additional data frames with proper headers:

```r
# Table "SalesData" on sheet "Products" (A1:E151)
SalesData <- Products[2:151, 1:5]
colnames(SalesData) <- c("Product", "Category", "Price", "Quantity", "Revenue")
```

### 4. Formulas — executed in dependency order

Each formula is translated and wrapped in error handling:

```r
# C7 = SUM(C4:C5)
Products$C[7] <- tryCatch(
  sum(Products$C[4:5], na.rm=TRUE),
  error = function(e) { message('Error in Products!C7: ', e$message); NA }
)
```

Cross-sheet references are resolved automatically. Execution order is determined by Kahn's topological sort.

### 5. Verify — compare R results against Excel

The Verify tab runs the generated script and compares every computed value against Excel's cached formula results:

- **Exact matches** — R and Excel agree
- **Precision diffs** — minor floating-point differences (< 0.0001), classified as harmless
- **NA/error diffs** — Excel errors (#VALUE!, #REF!) or uncached formulas, classified as harmless
- **Real mismatches** — values that genuinely differ, shown with the formula, R value, Excel value, and difference

### 6. Iterate — change inputs, rerun

Change North Q1 revenue from 150 to 300 in the CSV:
```
4,"C","300"
```
Rerun the script. Totals update. No Excel involved.

## Features

- **62 Excel functions** mapped to R equivalents (SUM, IF, VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, INDEX/MATCH, and more)
- **CSV standalone mode** — export data as tidy CSVs, generated script uses base R only, zero dependencies
- **Built-in verification** — run the script and compare every result against Excel's cached values
- **Named table detection** — Excel ListObjects become properly named R data frames with real column headers
- **Auto-detects** all sheets and their actual dimensions
- **Cross-sheet references** resolved with dependency-ordered execution (Kahn's topological sort)
- **Balanced-parenthesis parser** handles nested functions like `SUM(IF(A1>0,B1,0))`
- **Interactive review** of every formula transformation before download
- **Unsupported functions** clearly flagged (not silently skipped)

## Quick Start

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "bslib", "DT", "tidyxl", "openxlsx2", "readxl"))
shiny::runApp("path/to/excel2r-app")
```

Upload an Excel file and follow the 5-step workflow:

**Upload** → **Review** formulas → **Configure** options → **Download** .R script or .zip → **Verify** against Excel

## Demo

## How It Works

```
Upload .xlsx
    │
    ▼
1. Extract formulas (tidyxl) + detect named tables (openxlsx2)
    │
    ▼
2. Tokenize & parse (balanced-paren parser)
    │
    ▼
3. Transform: cell refs → R syntax, functions → R equivalents
    │
    ▼
4. Determine execution order (Kahn's topological sort)
    │
    ▼
5. Generate output:
   ├── Excel mode: .R script (reads .xlsx at runtime)
   └── CSV mode: .zip with .R script + tidy CSVs (standalone)
    │
    ▼
6. Verify: run script, compare R values vs Excel cached results
```

source("run_tests.R")
```

Covers unit tests for each module (parser, transforms, dependency ordering, CSV export, verification), integration tests against the demo workbook, and shinytest2 tests for the UI.

## Dependencies

**App:** shiny, bslib, DT, tidyxl, openxlsx2, readxl

**Generated scripts (Excel mode):** openxlsx2

**Generated scripts (CSV mode):** none — base R only

## Future Work

- **Structured table references** — translate `Table1[Column]` and `[@Column]` syntax using detected table metadata
- **Named ranges** — resolve workbook-level and sheet-level named ranges into cell references
